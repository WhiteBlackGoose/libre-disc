## What is DISC?

DISC is a behavioral assessment model that categorizes people along four dimensions:

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **D** – Dominance | How you handle problems and challenges |
| **I** – Influence | How you interact with and persuade others |
| **S** – Steadiness | How you respond to pace and consistency |
| **C** – Conscientiousness | How you approach rules, procedures, and quality |

Most people are a blend of two adjacent dimensions. This test covers **16 personality types** — 4 pure types (D, I, S, C), 4 equal blends (DI, IS, SC, CD), and 8 dominant blends (Di, Id, Is, Si, Sc, Cs, Cd, Dc).
